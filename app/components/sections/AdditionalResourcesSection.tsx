    title: "Property titles and mineral rights.",
    body: "In many parts of the U.S., the rights to what's on a piece of land and the rights to what's under it can be owned separately—that's called a mineral rights split. Property titles often indicate whether mineral rights are included with the surface rights or held by someone else. It's usually the first place this information shows up.",
  },
  {
    title: "Mineral rights attorneys.",
    body: "When a title is unclear or silent on mineral rights, attorneys who specialize in this area do the research to trace ownership back through public records. It's a niche specialty—not every real estate lawyer handles it. People with questions about who actually owns the mineral rights under their land often start here.",
  },
  {
    title: "Geological surveying companies.",
    body: "Geological surveyors map what's underground—how much of a given resource might be present, how deep it sits, and how it's distributed. They use tools like core sampling, seismic imaging, and geochemical analysis. This is the step where curiosity turns into real data about a deposit's size and shape.",
  },
  {
    title: "Prospecting communities.",
    body: "Prospecting organizations are membership-based groups of hobbyists and professionals who share knowledge, host events, and sometimes provide access to claim sites. People drawn to the hands-on side of things—the curious, the weekend explorers—often find their way into these communities.",

  {
    title: "Mining claim filing services.",
    body: "Claim filing services handle the paperwork to stake and register a claim with the appropriate government agency. It's a path people explore when they're interested in pursuing a find on public land, or when they're looking at land where the mineral rights aren't already held by someone else.",

    title: "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies.",
    body: "The EPA and state-level environmental agencies publish public guidance on common contaminants, typical exposure levels, and what different findings generally mean. Many states also run follow-up testing programs for residents, sometimes at no cost. People looking for free, reliable background information often find it here.",
  },
  {
    title: "Environmental consultants.",
    body: "Environmental consulting firms help interpret results and build a plan. They don't do the cleanup work themselves—they assess the situation, identify likely sources, and recommend a course of action to their clients. People who want expert eyes on a finding before taking any next steps often engage a consultant first.",
  },
  {
    title: "Environmental remediation companies.",
    body: "Remediation companies are the ones who actually do the cleanup work—removing contaminated soil, treating it on-site, or capping affected areas. Most residential situations don't call for this level of intervention, but it's one of the categories that exists in this space.",
  },
  {
    title: "Storage tank specialists.",
    body: "When petroleum contamination shows up in residential soil, a leaking underground storage tank is one of the more common sources—especially on older properties that once used oil heating. Storage tank specialists locate, inspect, and (when needed) remove or replace these tanks.",
  },
  {
    title: "Environmental insurance.",
    body: "Some insurance providers offer policies that cover unexpected environmental hazards and remediation costs. It's a category that tends to come up when people are thinking about long-term liability or protection against future exposure on a property.",

              <p>
                If your report flagged traces of precious metals or rare earth elements, or showed signs of crude oil,
                there&apos;s a whole world of people and companies that work in this space. This page is a

                If your report flagged elevated levels of heavy metals or signs of petroleum contamination, the good news
                is that this is well-trodden territory. There&apos;s an entire industry built around understanding and
